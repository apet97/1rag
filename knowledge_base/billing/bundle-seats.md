# Bundle Seats

Each active and invited user with a unique email in any product requires a seat. If you have the bundle, users need to have the same email address across products to count as one bundle seat. So for example, if you have a user in Clockify with one email and in Pumble with another, that counts as two separate bundle seats. When you deactivate some user on all three products, you free up their seat so another person can take their paid seat.

## Add bundle seat

 Follow these instructions to add bundle seats: 

1. Navigate to the **Subscription** page in [Clockify](https://app.clockify.me/en/signup) or [Plaky](https://app.plaky.com/login), or **Billing** page in [Pumble](https://pumble.com/login)
2. In the **Payment** tab, under **Current plan** click **Add** to add more seats / in Plaky click on **\+** button or manually enter the desired number of seats on the **Subscription** page
3. Use the **\+** button or manually enter the desired number of seats
4. Continue after you’ve read **CAKE.com Terms of Use** and info about price and refunds
5. Proceed with the payment process and complete the subscription

Get more info about the payment process in [Clockify](https://clockify.me/help/administration/payment-process), [Pumble](https://pumble.com/help/workspace-administration/pricing/upgrade-a-free-workspace-to-a-paid-plan/), and [Plaky](https://plaky.com/help/administration/billing/upgrade-a-free-organization-to-a-paid-plan/).

One bundle seat allows you to invite one person (one unique email address) to Clockify, Pumble, and Plaky. Whether they use one, two, or all three apps, it doesn’t matter. So for example, if you have 10 bundle seats, you can have a situation where 5 people use all three products, 2 people use just Plaky, 2 people use just Pumble, and 1 person uses just Clockify – which reaches your limit of 10 unique email addresses across all three products.

Only full regular seats are counted in bundle. Other seat variants are treated according to their respective product pricing:

* **Clockify**: Limited users in Clockify are purchased separately according to Clockify’s ENTERPRISE pricing, and cannot be managed through Pumble.
* **Pumble**: You get single\-channel guest users in Pumble for free based on number of paid seats times five (e.g. for 10 seats you can have up to 50 single\-channel guest users). Note: multi\-channel guests take up one full regular seat.
* **Plaky**: You get viewer users in Plaky for free based on number of paid seats times five (e.g. for 10 seats you can have up to 50 viewer users).

## Remove bundle seat

While we are actively developing a solution to enhance user autonomy and allow users to remove bundle seats independently, our support team handles the removal of bundle seats. To remove a bundle seat, please get in touch with our [support team](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4d3e383d3d223f390d2e2c2628602528213d6321222e2c21) and they will assist you in the process.
