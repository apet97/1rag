# Individual Subscription

Each CAKE.com app offers a free version with its core features, but you can unlock premium functionalities by upgrading to a paid subscription. If you only need a paid subscription in one or two apps, and not the whole CAKE.com Bundle, purchasing individual subscriptions are a way to go.

Each app has multiple subscription options, which can be purchased directly from the app. Check out these articles to learn more about purchasing subscription plans in each individual app:

* [Clockify](https://clockify.me/help/administration/subscribe-upgrade)
* [Pumble](https://pumble.com/help/workspace-administration/pricing/upgrade-a-free-workspace-to-a-paid-plan/)
* [Plaky](https://plaky.com/help/administration/billing/upgrade-a-free-workspace-to-a-paid-plan/)

Individual subscription plans are specific to a single app and apply to one workspace within that app where the subscription is purchased. For example, within the same organization, you can have multiple workspaces in one app, each with its own subscription plan (e.g. an organization with two Clockify workspaces, one on basic and other on Enterprise plan). 

Since the organization owner is also the owner of each workspace within the organization, when subscribing to a paid plan, the owner seat is charged in each workspace subscribed to a paid plan. 

Individual subscriptions are managed from the app they are purchased in. 

*If you’re looking to use Enterprise plans across all CAKE.com apps, the **Bundle subscription plan** is the ideal choice. It provides a comprehensive solution for accessing premium features on every app.*
