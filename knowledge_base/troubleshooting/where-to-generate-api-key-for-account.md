# Where to generate API key for account

1 min read

To generate an API key for your Clockify account, follow these steps:

1. Go to your account menu in the top right corner
2. Select **Preferences**
3. In the **Preferences** menu, click on the **Advanced** tab
4. In the **API Key** section, click on **Generate** to create a new API key
5. Copy and store the key

After the key is generated, **immediately copy** the API key and store it somewhere secure. Once you close the window, the key will no longer be visible

Ensure that the API key is stored securely, as it cannot be viewed again after the window is closed.
