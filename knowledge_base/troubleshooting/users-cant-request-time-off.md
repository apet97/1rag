# Users can’t request Time Off

2 min read

If a team member is unable to submit a time off request, here are the most common reasons and how to resolve them.

## The user is not assigned to the time off policy [\#](#the-user-is-not-assigned-to-the-time-off-policy)

If a user is not assigned to any time off policy, they won’t be able to request time off. 

Admins can check this by following the steps below:

1. Navigate to the Time Off page
2. Click on the Cog icon and select “Manage policies”
3. Click on the three dots and select “Edit”
4. Make sure that the user is listed under the “Assignees” menu

## The user does not have sufficient time off balance [\#](#the-user-does-not-have-sufficient-time-off-balance)

Even if a user is assigned to the policy, they won’t be able to request time off if their balance is zero.

To check their balance:

1. Navigate to the Time Off page from the sidebar
2. Click on the Balance tab
3. Filter by User or Policy to view the available balance

If they don’t have enough balance:

* Add to their balance manually by clicking on the three dots
* Or, go to the policy settings and enable “Allow negative balance” to let users request time off even if they don’t have enough available days
