# Unable to transfer the ownership

1 min read

If you are trying to transfer ownership of a Clockify workspace but don’t see the option, it’s likely because you’re not in the right place, or you don’t have the required permissions.

## Only the current workspace owner can transfer ownership [\#](#only-the-current-workspace-owner-can-transfer-ownership)

If you are not the current owner, you won’t see the option to transfer. Ownership can only be transferred by the person who currently holds it. 

## How to transfer ownership [\#](#how-to-transfer-ownership)

You won’t find the transfer option on the Team page; it’s only available from the [CAKE.com](http://cake.com) account page.

To transfer ownership:

1. Click on your profile picture and select “Manage [CAKE.com](http://cake.com) account”
2. Navigate to the “Members” tab
3. Find the user you want to assign as the new owner
4. Click on the three dots next to their name
5. Select “Transfer ownership”

Once transferred, you’ll automatically be assigned the admin role.
