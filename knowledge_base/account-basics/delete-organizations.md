7. Click **Delete** on the confirmation modal to complete the action

To enable the deletion of the organization, all users must be removed from the product workspaces including canceling pending invitations.

Deleting your organization will permanently remove all related data, including the workspaces within it. All active subscriptions linked to the organization will be automatically canceled. To avoid losing any important information, back up your data before you continue with the process.
