# What is CAKE.com Productivity Suite?

## Overview

In the bustling landscape of modern business, efficiency is key. From managing time to facilitating seamless communication and overseeing projects, having the right tools at your disposal can make all the difference.

**CAKE.com Suite** is a cohesive set of productivity solutions designed to simplify and streamline your workflow. At its core, CAKE.com Suite comprises three distinct yet interconnected apps:

Clockify

Pumble

Plaky

Clockify is a time tracker and timesheet app that lets you track working hours across projects. Whether you’re tracking billable hours, monitoring project progress, or simply optimizing your daily schedule, Clockify offers robust time\-tracking features to help you make the most of every moment.

### Organization

Once your CAKE.com Account is created, an **organization** is created within it, with you as the owner. This organization serves as the foundation for your collaborative endeavors within the CAKE.com ecosystem. While you’re the owner of your default organization, CAKE.com Suite gives you the flexibility to join other organizations as a member or administrator. 

### Workspace

Within any organization, you can create multiple workspaces on any of the CAKE.com products, tailored to your specific needs. Each organization needs to have at least one workspace (at least the workspace that you create upon signing up, along with the organization). CAKE.com Productivity Suite allows you to manage and switch between all of your workspaces directly from your CAKE.com Account.

## Your team

Every CAKE.com organization has a team of users with varying administrative permissions. As a whole, an organization is typically comprised of the following people:

* Organization owner – Created Organization and set permissions
* Workspace admin – An admin of Clockify, Pumble or Plaky workspace
* Organization member – Any user of Clockify, Pumble or Plaky workspace without admin role
