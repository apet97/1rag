# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is CAKE.com Productivity Suite?

**CAKE.com Suite** is a cohesive set of productivity solutions designed to simplify and streamline your workflow. At its core, CAKE.com Suite comprises three distinct yet interconnected apps:

* Clockify
* Pumble
* Plaky

Upon registering to any of the CAKE.com products, you’re granted access to your very own **CAKE.com Account** – a centralized hub where all your organizational needs are met. From here, you can switch apps and workspaces, access user and organization management pages if you have adequate permissions, as well as subscription management page. 

While creating a workspace in any of the CAKE.com apps, you’ll be asked to name an organization. By creating an organization you become its owner. Each workspace has to be a part of an organization. You can be a member of workspaces that belong to different Organizations, with different roles in each workspace/organization.

## Why do I have CAKE.com Account? Where did it come from?

We have introduced **CAKE.com Suite** – a cohesive set of productivity solutions designed to simplify and streamline your workflow. At its core, CAKE.com Suite comprises three distinct yet interconnected apps:

* Clockify
* Pumble
* Plaky

Your Workspace has been migrated to a **CAKE.com Organization** and as a part of the Organization you have been assigned a CAKE.com Account. It’s a centralized hub, from which you can switch apps and workspaces within those apps. Your CAKE.com Account is associated with your email address. Each time you log in to any of the CAKE.com apps you are automatically logged in to your CAKE.com Account. 

## How to create CAKE.com Account/Organization?

When creating a workspace in any of our apps – Clockify, Pumble or Plaky, you will be required to name an organization in one of the steps of the workspace creation. With a workspace creation, a CAKE.com organization is created as well, and you get access to your own CAKE.com Account.

You can only have one CAKE.com Account with one email address, but you can be a member of different organizations with your CAKE.com Account.

## Why do I need to choose an Organization when creating a Workspace?

Each workspace needs to belong to an organization. You can be a member of more than one organization with your CAKE.com Account (with your email address). If you belong to multiple Organizations and want to create a new workspace, you´ll need to choose in which organization you want to place the newly created workspace (you can choose among the organizations in which you have permissions to create a workspace).  

## A new way to create a Workspace – directly from the Organization?

If you would like to create a new workspace in one of the CAKE.com apps you are already using or try out a new CAKE.com app, you can create a new workspace directly from your CAKE.com Account. To do it:

1. Navigate to **Workspaces** from the left sidebar
2. Click on **\+ Create workspace** in the top right corner
3. Select the product from the dropdown
4. Enter workspace name
5. Click **Confirm** to complete the action

As a result, your workspace will appear in the list of workspaces created in the organization.

## What happened with my regional account on Clockify?

If your workspace is already hosted on one of the regional servers we support, simply log in to your CAKE.com organization and select the desired workspace from the region switcher.

If you’d like to create a new workspace on a regional server, you’ll need to first sign up for a global region. After that, please reach out to our support team to request the transfer of your workspace to the regional server.

## How to access my CAKE.com Account?

To access your CAKE.com Account, go to CAKE.com login page – link and follow these steps:

1. Enter your email in the designated field to get the verification code
2. Click on **Continue with email**
3. Enter the verification code you’ve got to your email address or click on the link from the email
4. Select the organization (if you are a member of more than one)  to complete the login process

Or choose to

### Log in with Google

1. Open CAKE.com login page from your web browser
2. Click on **Continue with Google**
3. Select your Google account
4. Select the organization (if you are a member of more than one) to complete the login process

Or choose to

### Log in with Apple

1. Open CAKE.com login page from your web browser
2. Click on **Continue with Apple**
3. Sign in to your Apple account
4. Select the organization (if you are a member of more than one) to complete the login process

When logging in to any of the CAKE.com apps workspace (Clockify, Pumble, Plaky), you will automatically be logged in to your CAKE.com Account associated with the workspace you’re accessing.

## Why can’t I log in to Plaky/Clockify with my password?

Clockify and Plaky have switched to a passwordless login. **Passwordless login** is an authentication method that completely removes the need for passwords. Instead of entering a password, you need to authenticate yourself by using OTP code sent to your email address. 

How passwordless login works in Clockify and Plaky:

1. Enter your email address in the Clockify/Plaky login page
2. A verification code is sent to your email address
3. Enter the verification code in the designated fields in the login page
4. After authentication, you’ll be automatically logged in to your Clockify/Plaky account

**Passwordless login** offers improved security compared to traditional password\-based authentication and several more advantages:

* **Convenience**  
No need to remember or type a password. Just a single action (entering an OTP code) grants access
* **Increased Security**  
Without passwords, you eliminate common password\-related security risks:
	* **Password reuse** (using the same password across multiple sites)
	* **Phishing attacks** (tricking users into entering their password on a fake site)
	* **Weak or stolen passwords**
* **Lower risk of account compromise**:  
As there are no passwords involved, there is no risk of a password being leaked, guessed, or stolen through brute\-force attacks.

## How to change my name, email address, profile picture in Plaky, Clockify, Pumble, CAKE.com?

You can change your profile information only from your CAKE.com Account. Once you change it, it is automatically applied to all the workspaces of all the CAKE.com apps you are a member of. To change profile info:

1. Log in to your CAKE.com Account
2. Click on your profile icon at the top right corner of your CAKE.com home page
3. Select **My profile**
4. Click on **Edit** button
5. Modify your profile details:  
  
**Profile picture**: Upload a new profile picture  
  
**Name and email**: Update your name or email address
6. Click **Save** to confirm the changes

If you need to change your email address, follow the prompts to verify your new email. You’ll receive confirmation emails to both your old and new email addresses.

## Why are my workspaces (Plaky, Clockify, Pumble) in different organizations?

If you created your workspaces in any of the CAKE.com products: Plaky, Clockify, Pumble using different emails, these workspaces have been transferred to separate organizations. If you’d like to have them within the same organization, you can transfer workspaces from one organization to another, but the organizations need to be under the same email address, which means you need to change the email address of one of your organizations. Check out this article for more information on how to change the Organization email address. Follow these steps to perform the transfer:

1. Log in to CAKE.com with the email address you used to create given workspace (or the changed email address if you had to change it)
2. Open **Workspace management** page
3. Select the workspace
4. You’ll get the details about the workspace (details about users, hosting – region/custom domain/subdomain/installed add\-ons)
5. Click on the **Transfer to another organization** option to initiate the transfer
6. Search and select the destination organization
7. Preview the transfer
8. Click **Confirm** to complete the transfer

Prior to initiating the transfer, review the transfer details, including the workspace name, destination organization, and any relevant settings or data changes.

Please note that workspace transfer procedures may vary depending on the subscription plan of the origin and destination organizations.

If the transfer is unsuccessful, verify that you have the necessary permissions and retry the process. For persistent issues, consult the CAKE.com support team for assistance.

## If I delete my Organization, what happens to all the data? Does it affect workspace data too?

After you delete the organization:

* All organization data, including data across all products will be permanently deleted and cannot be restored
* All users previously deactivated on product workspaces will be permanently deleted; pending invitations are canceled
* All active subscriptions will be terminated
* In case this is your onlyorganization, your CAKE.com Account, along with all your personal information will also be deleted. You will be redirected to the cake.com login page

## I want to delete my Organization, but it says I cannot do it because I still have some active users. What should I do?

Before deleting your organization, you must deactivate all users across all workspaces and remove any pending user invitations. Depending on your role and permissions, you can manage these actions either from the organization settings or directly from the workspace settings within the product. For more information, check out [this article](https://cake.com/help/administration/deactivate-and-delete-user-account/).

## How to rename Workspace?

You can rename a workspace both at the organization level and within the workspace settings.  

### To rename a workspace from the organization settings:

1. Go to the **Workspaces** page
2. Select the workspace you want to rename and click the three\-dot menu
3. Click **Edit name and image**
4. Update the name and save your changes

### To rename a workspace at the workspace level:

1. Go to the **workspace settings** within the product
2. Update the workspace name as needed

## I cannot delete my Workspace, it says I cannot do it because I still have some active users. What should I do?

The same process as with the organization applies when deleting a workspace with active users. Before you can delete your workspace, you must deactivate all users and remove any pending invitations. Depending on your role and permissions, you can manage this either from the organization settings or directly from the workspace settings within the product.  

## I deleted a workspace and my Organization disappeared, why?

If you delete the only workspace in an organization, the entire organization will be deleted as well. Please note that deleting the sole workspace will also permanently remove all data associated with both the workspace and the organization.  

## I am an admin in a workspace, but I can no longer perform some actions that I could earlier, why?

With the CAKE.com Suite there are some changes in the permissions made to the workspace admin role.

Within the CAKE.com organization, a workspace admin:

* Can manage the Bundle (activate, add, or remove seats), but cannot update customer or invoice information
* Cannot delete a workspace
* Cannot delete user profile information
* Cannot edit the profile information of other users

## How to deactivate a user from workspace?

On the Members page, organization owners can deactivate users from the workspace. Once this option is selected, a new screen will appear with a clear explanation of how this action will impact both the organization and the workspace.

When a user is deactivated, their data remains stored within the workspace and the organization. Similarly, when a user is deleted, their data is retained, but the user’s identity is replaced with an alias in the applications. In both cases, the data is not permanently removed. If the user is reactivated, their data is fully restored. Check out [this article](https://cake.com/help/administration/deactivate-and-delete-user-account/) for more information. 

## I changed my profile data in CAKE.com and it changed in Pumble (or any app) as well, why?

Any changes made to your CAKE.com Account are automatically applied to all the workspaces you belong to within your CAKE.com organization.  

## Can I keep my paid subscription/subscribe to just one CAKE.com app?

Yes, you can subscribe to just one CAKE.com app and keep your paid subscription for that app only. Each CAKE.com app offers individual subscription plans, so if you only need PRO features in one app (e.g., Clockify, Pumble, or Plaky), you can purchase a subscription specifically for that app.

For example, within the same organization, you can have multiple workspaces in one app, each with its own subscription plan (e.g. one workspace on the Basic plan and another on the Enterprise plan).

If you need Enterprise features across multiple CAKE.com apps, you can also consider the **Bundle** subscription plan, which provides access to all Enterprise features across all CAKE.com apps.

## Can I have different workspaces of the same app (e.g. Clockify) in one organization with different subscription plans?

Yes, you can have multiple workspaces of the same product that is part of our CAKE.com Suite and with different subscription plans. 

An organization can have multiple workspaces, and each workspace can have its own subscription plan. This flexibility allows organizations to create their subscription plans based on the needs of different teams or departments within the same organization.

For example, in your organization:

* **Workspace 1 (Clockify)** could be on a **Free** plan.
* **Workspace 2 (Clockify)** could be on a **Pro** plan.
* **Workspace 3 (Clockify)** could be on an **Enterprise** plan.

Each workspace is treated as a separate entity regarding subscriptions, meaning each one can independently subscribe to different plans. However, it’s important to note that if your organization subscribes to a **Bundle** plan (covering multiple products), the Bundle subscription will replace the individual subscriptions for the products included in the Bundle. The Bundle would then apply to all workspaces for those products.If you manage multiple workspaces with different subscription plans, you can view and manage each workspace’s subscription through the **Subscription page** in your CAKE.com Account. This is a centralized place where you can see all subscriptions, modify them, and any other details.

## I am a member of 3 paid workspaces in one Organization and they charge my seat for all 3\. Why?

If you are a member of 3 paid workspaces within the same organization, you are charged for each workspace because **each workspace has its own subscription**. Even though you are the same user, each workspace you belong to requires a separate seat for billing purposes. 

Therefore, if each workspace is on a paid plan, you will be charged for a seat in each workspace, even if you are the same person. So, if you are part of 3 different workspaces, each on a paid plan, you’ll be charged 3 separate times, one for each workspace’s seat. Check out [this article](https://cake.com/help/billing/bundle-seats/) for more information about bundle seats, and these articles for more information about seats on individual subscriptions of each product: [Clockify](https://clockify.me/help/administration/subscribe-upgrade), [Pumble](https://pumble.com/help/workspace-administration/pricing/user-seats/), [Plaky](https://plaky.com/help/administration/billing/guide-to-user-seats-at-plaky/).

This billing structure is how the system manages subscriptions for individual workspaces, and customer information is shared across all products within the organization. Check out [this article](https://cake.com/help/billing/subscription-management/) for more information on how to manage subscriptions.
