# Sign up at CAKE.com

When signing up for CAKE.com, there are two key options to get started. You can either create a new CAKE.com Account, or join an organization through an invitation. This article provides a detailed walkthrough of the sign\-up process.

## Create CAKE.com Account

You can sign up for a CAKE.com Account directly from the page of each individual app by creating a workspace on any of the three apps. Follow these instructions to get started:

Clockify

Pumble

Plaky

1. Navigate to the Clockify [sign up page](https://app.clockify.me/en/signup)
2. Follow the instructions from [this article](https://clockify.me/help/getting-started/start-using-clockify)

1. Navigate to the Pumble [sign up page](https://pumble.com/register)
2. Follow the instructions from [this article](https://pumble.com/help/getting-started/pumble-basics/register-at-pumble/)

1. Navigate to the Plaky [sign up page](https://app.plaky.com/signup)
2. Follow the instructions from [this article](https://plaky.com/help/getting-started/introduction-to-plaky/sign-up-at-plaky/)

During the sign\-up process for Clockify, Pumble, or Plaky, you create a workspace in the selected app, your CAKE.com Account and your first organization. The workspace created during your sign\-up to Clockify, Pumble or Plaky is a part of that organization and shares the same name that you assigned to the organization. As the owner of that organization, you’ll have full control and administrative privileges within your CAKE.com Account.

Check out [this article](https://cake.com/help/account-basics/manage-workspaces/#create-new-workspace) to learn how to create more workspaces within an organization.

CAKE.com Account enables you to effortlessly access all your apps and manage them efficiently.

You can create only one CAKE.com Account per email address. However, with a single CAKE.com Account, you have the flexibility to be a member of multiple organizations and workspaces.

## Join an invitation

You may receive invitations to join a workspace on:

* [Clockify](https://clockify.me/help/users/inviting-users#accepting-the-invite)
* [Pumble](https://pumble.com/help/getting-started/pumble-basics/register-at-pumble/#joining-a-workspace)
* [Plaky](https://plaky.com/help/getting-started/introduction-to-plaky/sign-up-at-plaky/#join-an-invitation-to-a-plaky-organization)

By accepting these invitations, as instructed in the articles linked above, you’ll automatically create a CAKE.com Account. This account will make you a member of the CAKE.com organization to which belongs the workspace you are joining. 

By joining an invitation to a Clockify, Pumble or Plaky workspace, you can also become a member/admin of the organization that is associated with the given workspace.
