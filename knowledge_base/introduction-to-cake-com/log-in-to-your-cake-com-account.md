When logging in to any of the CAKE.com apps workspace (Clockify, Pumble, Plaky), you will automatically be logged in to your CAKE.com Account associated with the workspace you’re accessing. 

**For Members:**

* If you only have a workspace in one or two apps within the CAKE.com Suite, you can ask the organization owner to create a workspace in the other app.

**For Owners/Admins:**

* If you’re the organization owner or an admin in any app’s workspace, you can create a workspace in another CAKE.com app yourself from the login page of that particular app. Check out [this article](https://cake.com/help/introduction-to-cake-com/sign-up-at-cake-com/) for more information.
