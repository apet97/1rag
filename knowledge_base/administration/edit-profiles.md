# Edit users’ profiles

2 min read

Update your team member’s details without the need to ask them, or wait for an update.

Owners and Admins can edit users’ profile.

To edit user’s profile:

1. Go to the **Team** page
2. Click on the three dots next to the user’s name
3. Select **Edit profile**
4. Make the changes (week start\*, capacity, working days, entering user’s ID or setting the type of employment to part\-time)
5. Save changes

**Important notes:**

* Users can only edit their **email**, **profile picture** and **username** themselves on their [CAKE.com Account](https://cake.com/help/introduction-to-cake-com/what-is-cake-com-productivity-suite/#cake-com-account) page
* **Week start\*** cannot be changed if there are pending approvals
* If you have custom [user fields](https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/user-fields) (e.g. employee ID, department), you can edit these directly in the profile

[Week start](https://clockify.me/help/administration/edit-profiles) set up on the **Team** page overrides the default one in the [Workspace settings](https://clockify.me/help/track-time-and-expenses/workspaces#workspace-settings).

**Daily capacity** and **working days** **can** be edited regardless of the number of workspaces that the user has.

### Leave workspace [\#](#leave-workspace)

If a user no longer needs access to a workspace, they can leave it by following these steps:

1. Click on a workspace name in the upper left corner to open the **workspace picker**
2. Choose **Manage workspaces**

You’ll be redirected to the **Workspaces page** in your CAKE.com Account where you can complete the action.
