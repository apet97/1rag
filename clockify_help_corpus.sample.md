## Summary
Cake.com bundles Clockify, Pumble, and Plaky under one login so teams can chat, plan, and track time without juggling accounts.

## Canonical answer
Use your Cake.com organization to enable the apps you need per workspace. Workspaces inherit the organization plan and single sign-on configuration.

## Body
After creating an organization, invite teammates and decide which apps should be enabled for each workspace. Billing and authentication live at the organization level, while product settings stay per app.

## Key points
- One login for Clockify, Pumble, and Plaky.
- Organization owners control which apps are enabled per workspace.
- Plans and SSO flow from the organization to each workspace.

## Limits & gotchas
- Disabling an app at the org level disables it for every workspace.
- App availability follows the organization plan; downgrading can remove features.

## FAQ
- *Can I enable only one app?* Yes—enable just the apps your teams need.
- *Do workspaces share billing?* Yes. Billing is managed at the organization level.

## Search hints
single sign-on, enable apps, organization plan, Cake login, multi-app workspace

## Internal notes
If access issues appear, confirm the app is enabled for the workspace and the organization plan includes that app.

## Summary
Organization owners can delete a workspace directly from the Workspaces page.

## Canonical answer
Go to Organization Settings → Workspaces, choose the workspace, select **Delete workspace**, and confirm its name to remove it.

## Body
Deleting a workspace removes its projects, members, and tracked time. Review billing seats tied to the workspace before deletion to avoid charges.

## Key points
- Only organization owners can delete workspaces.
- Deletion removes projects, members, and tracked time.
- Confirm the workspace name to finish deletion.

## Limits & gotchas
- The action is irreversible; data cannot be recovered after deletion.
- Ensure billing seats are transferred or downgraded before deletion.

## FAQ
- *Can I restore a deleted workspace?* No. Recreate a workspace if needed.
- *Who can delete?* Only organization owners—not members or managers.

## Search hints
delete workspace, remove workspace, organization settings, irreversible deletion

## Internal notes
If billing errors occur after deletion, verify seats were adjusted before the workspace was removed.
